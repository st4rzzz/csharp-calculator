# csharp-calculator
C# Calculator I made as a programming challenge. Still a beginner to c#. Made using Visual Studio Community. Has 9 numeric buttons and the basic 4 operators, works basically like a regular calculator. Just archiving here.
RUN SETUP AND/OR GUI APPLICATION TO INITIATE THE CALCULATOR. THE SOURCE CODE IS ALSO INCLUDED.
